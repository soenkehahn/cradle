`cradle` is a library for executing commands in a child process.

It's heavily inspired by [shake](https://shakebuild.com/), specifically the
[`cmd`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake-0.19.4/docs/Development-Shake.html#v:cmd) function.

`cradle` is currently in an experimental stage.
There's no promises on API stability yet, so APIs may change drastically!
Use at your own risk!
